# Shopping-Website
This is an incomplete website where I am learning to create a login system.

To run it, get a database website (like Firebase) and set it up. It will provide config settings that will be placed in a .env file in its respective line.

VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY= apiKey
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN= ...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID= ...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET= ...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID = ...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID= ...

Finally, in git bash, write npx vite and run the website.
